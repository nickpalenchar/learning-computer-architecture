# In MIPS, memory is addressed in bytes of 4. That is, each index is a multiple of 4
#
# address = i4
#
#
# To Access:
#   A[3]
#
# You would write:

lw $t0,12($s3) # lw = "load word" - index 3 x 4 = 12, and $s3 is base address (given at runtime)

# Example:
#   A[12] = h + A[8]
#

lw  $t0,32($s3)
add $t0,$s2,$t0
sw  $t0,48($s3)

# COMMAND: Add Immediate
addi $s3,$s3,4  # immediately adds constant 4 to s3 (no need to load)
