REGISTERS for proceedures

$a0 - $a3: four arguments
$v0, $v1: value registers for return values
$ra - return address

"Jump and link" function to go to proceedure and save the return value to $ra

```
jal ProceedureAddress
```

> ðŸ’¡ the $ra is at register 31 (the last register of the language??)

Return from a proceedure with `jr $ra`


## Creating a stack

A call stack, like in high level languages, when you need to keep track of all calls, which will need to be loaded into memory.

-> Register `$sp` for **stack pointer** to point to where the current call is.
